# Archon

May 2023 ~ August 2023 (4 months)

A personal web development project to implement an SPA using pure JavaScript, based on a fictional magazine site themed around architecture.

## Features

- Articles in various categories
- Bookmarking and management
- Responsive design

## Technical Focus

- Implemented SPA directly using JavaScript
- Router implementation using History API
- Partial dynamic rendering using HandlebarsJS and JSON files
- CSS modularization utilizing BEM methodology and utility classes

## Reflection

- Developing an SPA structure using only pure JavaScript allowed me to consider the necessity and value of libraries and frameworks.
- Implementing the router myself increased my understanding of the importance and role of routing functionality within libraries in an SPA.
- Experience with implementing back and forward functionality and address management using the History API enhanced my knowledge of browser navigation and state management.
- The design composition process using Figma made me realize the importance of design systems and componentization.
- Learning about partial rendering during the use of a template engine made me aware of the importance of performance optimization.
- Studying the script loading order (async, defer) provided me with methods to improve web page loading performance.

## Next

- I need to complete the responsive design that was left unfinished due to time constraints.
- Plan to use frameworks or libraries to improve code efficiency and scalability. (â†’ V2)
