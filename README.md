# Archon v1

July 2023 ~ September 2023 (3 months)

This is a personal web development project, where I created a fictional magazine site focused on architecture using pure JavaScript to implement a SPA.

## Features

- **Categorized Articles**: Users can read various articles on architecture, categorized by topics.
- **Navigation and Accessibility**:
  - Side navigation allows users to easily explore different sections of the site.
  - Grayscale mode enhances readability and usability for visually impaired users.
  - Users can filter and sort articles by contributors, tags, and dates to find content that matches their interests.
- **Bookmarking**: Users can bookmark articles to read later.
- **Article Recommendations**:
  - Displays a list of related articles, helping users discover more content based on their interests.
  - Clearly separates highlighted articles from the latest articles for easy navigation to the most relevant and recent content.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is adjusted to ensure smooth viewing on mobile devices.

## Technical Focus

- Developed to function similarly to a SPA using JavaScript, implementing a router with the History API.
- Utilized HandlebarsJS and JSON files for dynamic data rendering.
  - Assumed the use of a mock data API to simulate asynchronous data loading.
- Used BEM methodology for CSS naming and defined utility classes to modularize styles.

## Reflection

- Implementing a SPA structure using pure JavaScript allowed me to appreciate the necessity and value of libraries and frameworks.
- By developing the router myself, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance and role of routing functionality in SPAs.
- Experience with the History API for implementing back, forward, and address management enhanced my knowledge of browser navigation and state management.
- Using Figma for the design process helped me realize the importance of design systems and componentization.
- Learning about partial rendering while using a template engine highlighted the importance of performance optimization.
- Studying the script loading order (async, defer) allowed me to learn methods to improve web page loading performance.

## Next Steps

- Complete the responsive design aspect that was not fully realized due to time constraints.
- Plan to use frameworks or libraries to enhance code efficiency and scalability. (â†’ V2)
